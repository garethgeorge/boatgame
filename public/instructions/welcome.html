        Scoring & Treasures
    </h2>
    <p id="instructions-body-text">
        The river is filled with Floating Bottles. These serve as both currency and shielding. Sail
        over floating bottles to bring them aboard. Some contain secret messages or maps to bonus treasures. </p>
    <p id="instructions-body-text">
        Trading: Dock at bottle depots to trade bottles (and any treasures/maps) for points.
    </p>
    <p id="instructions-body-text">
        Risk/Reward: Holding bottles is dangerous but necessary.
    </p>
    <p id="instructions-body-text">
        Collision - Animals are Hazards: The river is alive and hostile. Your "Health" is tied to your bottle inventory.
        If you crash into wildlife (crocodiles, bears, sharks..), you lose 1 Bottle. If you have no bottles, a point
        will be deducted directly. Points are worth twice as much as bottles. So, players must decide whether to "bank"
        bottles at a Depot for points or keep them on deck as armor against damage incurred by running into wildlife.
