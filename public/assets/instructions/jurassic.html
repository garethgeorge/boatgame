        Fun Facts: Jurassic Park (the movie) features dinos such as Tyrannosaurus rex & Velociraptor from the Cretaceous (which followed the Jurassic). Earth was 5-10ºC warmer than today with no polar ice caps. Huge, long-necked herbivores like Diplodocus and Brachiosaurus ruled the Jurassic. Small shrew-like noturnal mammals also emerged. The Jurassic is named for the Jura Mountains in France, where limestones from this era were first studied.
