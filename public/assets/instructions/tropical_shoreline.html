        Fun Facts: Tropical rainforests cover a small part of Earth, but host amazing biodiversity - over half our terrestrial species! They are called Earth's "lungs" producing significant oxygen.
The tropics are near the equator, from the Tropic of Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn: hence their name. The tropics host some of the world’s best beaches.
