        Fun Facts: In the Arctic (or North Pole) & Antarctica (South Pole), the sun rises and sets only once a year. The North Pole is covered in shifting ice but also holds 10% of the world's freshwater and is home to polar bears and indigenous peoples. Antarctica is a colder land continent covered by 90% of the world's ice, hosting Penguins and scientific researchers. The name Arctic is from the Greek word arktos (bear) for the northern constellations (Ursa Major/Great Bear and Ursa Minor/Lesser Bear), not for polar bears.
