        Fun Facts: Deserts (defined by receiving less than 40 cm of precipitation annually) cover a third of the Earth. Only 20% are sandy and hot. Most are rocky or icy. Every continent has deserts. Antarctica is largest overall. The Sahara is the largest hot desert.
Scorpions can’t swim, but they can float on water and survive underwater for two days by trapping air and slowing their metabolism.
A Saguaro cactus has shallow roots and a deep taproot to absorb and store water for up to a year - at capacity, it can weigh a ton.
