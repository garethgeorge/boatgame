        <li><strong>Dense Mangrove Roots</strong> hug the river banks and hide predators; stay center to not get stuck!</li>
        <li><strong>Tread carefully!</strong> Lily pads will slow you down. The swamp keeps secrets.</li>

    </ul>

        Fun facts: Mangroves are resilient coastal trees that filter saltwater, store massive amounts of carbon (more than the rainforests!), are vital nurseries for marine life, protect shorelines from storms with their roots (earning them the name "walking trees"), and house unique creatures, making them crucial for biodiversity and climate resilience.
